# Default Data Sets
## 1. State of The Union Speeches 
This dataset contains the text from US state of the union addresses ranging from 1914 to 2009. It has 3 rows: id, date-tag, text. The text is a segment of the speech. The id is the year the speech was given followed by a dash and then a number indicating which segment that row contains. The date_tag is simply the year that speech was given. 
## 2. Wikipedia Movie Summaries
This dataset is a version of the one found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots) that has been adapted for this project. It has 6 rows: date_tag, id, Origin/Ethnicity, Director, Cast, Genre, Wiki Page, text. The date_tag is the year it was released. The text is the wikipedia plot summary for that movie. Id is the title of the movie. Rows with identical plot descriptions have been dropped from the original dataset. From here, the dataset was cut down to 3000 random movies to speed up analysis of this demo dataset. Release dates of movies in the final dataset range from 1901 to 2017.
